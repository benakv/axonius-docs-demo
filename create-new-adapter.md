## Metadata_End
You can create new adapters (CSV/JSON/SQL Server only), each with its own unique pages and the same standard features that can be found in all adapters.

The system allows you to create up to 10 customized instances within each CSV/JSON adapter and up to 30 within each SQL Server adapter (50 in total). In the event that more custom adapters are needed, please contact Axonius Support. 

You can upload your own logo for each custom adapter you create. If you do not upload a logo, each custom adapter is  associated with the default logo for the source adapter (e.g., the Axonius CSV/JSON/SQL Server adapter logo).

 Custom adapters are displayed in the "Custom Adapter" category.
